The models evolve incredibly fast though, so we set down to compare them and find the best one for generating email content for Mautic.</p>\n\n<h2>The prompt used for testing</h2>\n<p>We used this same prompt for our GPT model testing:</p>\n<p><code>Generate an email to promote a Stripe payment plugin allowing you to sell digital products in Mautic. Use tokens {contactfield=firstname}, {unsubscribe_text} and a call to action button with link to {pagelink=1}.</code></p>\n<h2>GPT models</h2>\n<p>Each model has pros and cons. The main problem we wanted to solve was that some models are getting end of life and they are often way too slow to work with.</p>\n<h3>GPT 3.5</h3>\n<p>The GPT-3.5 models possess the remarkable capability to generate code and exhibit a foundational understanding of various natural languages.</p>\n<h4>gpt-3.5-turbo</h4>\n<p>This model points to gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 which <strong>will not be supported after June 2024.</strong> The API response takes around 1 minute which is painful to work with and can lead to timeouts which degrades user experience. The training data here extends up to <strong>September 2021</strong>. The maximum token limit for processing stands at <strong>4,096</strong>, enabling the model to effectively handle inputs of a certain length or complexity.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of generated email content.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"1102\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03-xs.png 300w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03-sm.png 480w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03-md.png 768w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03-lg.png 1024w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03-xl.png 1360w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.44.03-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>This is already a preview of the email so the unsubscribe token was replaced with the right text and the <code>{contactfield=firstname}</code> was switched to <code>[First Name]</code>. </p>\n<p>Notice that the model suggested an image in the email but it cannot work with images so it leads to an example URL.</p>\n<h4>gpt-3.5-turbo-1106</h4>\n<p>Representing the most recent addition to the GPT 3.5 model family, this model has <strong>training data up to September 2021</strong>, aligning its knowledge with developments and information available until that period. Notably, this iteration features an expanded token limit, capable of processing a maximum of <strong>16,385 tokens</strong>, thus accommodating longer and more intricate inputs compared to prior models in the series.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of generated email content.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1164\" height=\"1264\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57-xs.png 300w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57-sm.png 480w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57-md.png 768w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57-lg.png 1024w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57-xl.png 1360w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.48.57-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>GPT 4</h3>\n<p>Model GPT-4 represents a significant advancement over GPT-3.5, offering enhanced capabilities and features. This iteration of the model introduces the ability to process both text and image inputs while producing text-based outputs. GPT 4 possesses an updated understanding of language nuances and trends, enabling it to tackle complex tasks more effectively. Its extended exposure to recent data enhances its adaptability and comprehension of contemporary information.</p>\n<h4>gpt-4</h4>\n<p>Model gpt-4 refers to gpt-4-0613. The model's training data includes information up to <strong>September 2021</strong>, providing a comprehensive understanding of language patterns and structures up to that point in time. This model is optimised to process a maximum of <strong>8,192 tokens</strong>.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of generated email content.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1106\" height=\"1446\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45-xs.png 300w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45-sm.png 480w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45-md.png 768w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45-lg.png 1024w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45-xl.png 1360w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.54.45-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h4>gpt-4-1106-preview</h4>\n<p>The most recent GPT-4 model increases such as refined instruction following, compatibility with JSON mode, outputs that can be reproduced consistently, and the capability for parallel function calling, among other improvements. It delivers a maximum of <strong>4,096 tokens</strong> in its standard output, providing concise yet informative responses. The model has been trained with data <strong>up to April 2023</strong>, ensuring it has an updated understanding of recent information and trends.</p>\n<p>It's worth mentioning that this model is currently undergoing continuous development and refinement, thus <strong>not yet tailored for handling production-level traffic</strong>. For more extensive tasks or specialized applications, it has the capacity to process a maximum of 128,000 tokens, allowing for significantly longer text inputs and outputs.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of generated email content.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1212\" height=\"2070\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12-xs.png 300w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12-sm.png 480w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12-md.png 768w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12-lg.png 1024w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12-xl.png 1360w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2023-12-14-at-12.50.12-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Interesting here is that this model is using a free service that can generate images in specific dimension. You can tell the previous models to use that service too, but this one is using it by itself. It also adds some color without asking for it.</p>\n<h2>Testing the models</h2>\n<p>In our test we took the same prompt and asked each model 6 times to generate an email.

Everyone may prefer different characteristics. We ended up <strong>adding an option for our users to choose the right model for them</strong> from newer models gpt-3.5-turbo-1106, gpt-4 and gpt-41106-preview to the plugin configuration. The default model is set to gpt-4.</p>\n<p>Model GPT 3,5 Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) responses are simpler and less graphic, responses took less time and less token usage. Responses from GPT 4 Turbo (gpt-4-1106-preview) are more advanced response and better graphics, but it is more expensive with more token usage.</p>\n<p>Understanding the strengths and limitations of each model is crucial in harnessing the full potential of generative AI. We can't wait to hear from users of our <a href=\"https://chimpino.com/ai-plugin/\">AI plugin</a> about what model they've chosen. The new version of the AI plugin is already available and all existing customers have received it.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Help your team to automate payment processes and improve your customer experience at the same time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forget about click-through rate or open rate. <strong>Payment rate</strong> is what really matters!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h4>Magic segments</h4>\n<p>Segment filters seem like a good idea at first. But they have serious drawbacks.</p>\n<p>The main is that contacts will get to the segment only after your cron job runs. So every 10 minutes or so. That's way too slow! Your customers expect <strong>faster reactions</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Another is, ask your server admin how much does it cost to rebuild each and every segment every 10 minutes. It's not cheap.</em> 🤫</p>\n<p>The magic is quite simple, really. When you install this plugin, it will create a new segment for each Stripe event. And every time Stripe event happens, it will add the contact to the right segment. Fast, cheap, simple.</p>\n<p>And this simple magic allows you to run <strong>repeatable campaigns</strong>!</p>\n<h4>Segment filters</h4>\n<p>That being said, if you need a segment of all <strong>Stripe customers</strong>, we have you covered. There is a segment filter for that. It will give you all contacts that have a relation to a Stripe Customer.</p>\n<p>Tip: Stripe Customer doesn't have to be only a contact who paid for something. It could be a someone who filled in the checkout form but the payment didn't go through. I see the 💡 that came up in your marketer mind. I smell abandoned card scenario in the air! More on that later.</p>\n<h4>Landing page tokens</h4>\n<p>Stripe gives you a short HTML code to embed <strong>pricing tables</strong> or <strong>pay buttons</strong> to Mautic Landing Pages. We've tried that, doesn't work. The editor will strip parts of the HTML. We've got you covered. This plugin comes with special tokens for pricing tables and buttons. Details in the docs.</p>\n<h4>Email tokens</h4>\n<p>Stripe already allows you to add a link to a <strong>subscription management</strong> for your customers. It allows them to insert their email address and cancel or upgrade or downgrade their subscription. It's unique to your Stripe account. So there is no need for a token. It works out of the box.</p>\n<p>What we added a token for is the <strong>invoice link</strong>. Stripe generates an invoice for every payment. The token will find the latest invoice link in the Stripe events and send replace the token with it.</p>\n<p>Wait, wait what about the <strong>digital asset download link</strong>? That's a core Mautic feature, don't worry.</p>\n<p>There is one more thing that we didn't have to implement. The <strong>Stripe payment button works in the email</strong> already. It's just a link. You can send your contact to the payment gate directly from the email content. And track it with Mautic. Sweet!</p>\n<h4>Campaign conditions</h4>\n<p>Right, the <strong>abandoned cart</strong> type of workflow. There is a campaign condition that allows you to decide whether a contact went through one type of event but not another. So if you check if the \"Customer Created\" event exists, wait a day and check if the \"Invoice Paid\" event does not exist, you can send a message (SMS, email) to the contact asking what's wrong.</p>\n<p>Once you have more than 1 product, you may want to create <strong>different workflows for different products</strong>. We have a campaign condition for just that!</p>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>We've got you covered. Stripe sends the events to a public endpoint that the Stripe plugin configures. So some comedian could start sending similar events there. Don't worry, Stripe is signing each event message with secret key. You have to insert the secret key to the plugin configuration in order to be able to accept the messages. The plugin will reject all event messages that are not correctly signed.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js\"></script>\n<stripe-pricing-table pricing-table-id=\"prctbl_1OChTlDe6Bz3HFJoRcBk9foN\" publishable-key=\"pk_live_51NFhPoDe6Bz3HFJoBZkdv4NpV6hzKqD9rnSHtNOuh65VyduCcPENh2joNvfmV8Mr2AdxdzZZ3ueeAsikeuTwYT9D00OLPZzyaO\"> </stripe-pricing-table></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<div id=\"instalation\" class=\"container\">\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Once you become our member, you receive an email with a link to download the latest version of the Stripe bundle. It will be a zip package. Here is how you install it to your Mautic instance.</p>\n<h4>Using S/FTP</h4>\n<ol class=\"container\">\n<li>Upload the zip package to the <code>plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Unzip the package in the <code>plugins</code> directory.</li>\n<li>Go to Plugins in the Mautic administration and click on the \"Install/Update plugins\" button.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Using command line</h4>\n<p>Please modify the commands according to your login details and correct paths.</p>\n<ol class=\"container\">\n<li><code>scp ~/Downloads/StripeBundle.zip username@host:/var/www/yourmautic/plugins</code></li>\n<li><code>ssh username@host:/var/www/yourmautic/plugins</code></li>\n<li><code>unzip StripeBundle.zip</code></li>\n<li><code>bin/console mautic:plugins:install</code></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>Notice that 6 new segments were created after successful installation. You can delete those you don't want. Nothing bad will happen. If the incoming Stripe event won't find the specific event, it will simply store itself without adding the contact to the segment. You may have to delete the segments you don't want after every plugin update, though.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1824\" height=\"450\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34-xs.png 300w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34-sm.png 480w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34-md.png 768w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34-lg.png 1024w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34-xl.png 1360w ,https://chimpino.com/media/posts/4/responsive/Screenshot-2024-02-05-at-14.54.34-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>Configuration</h3>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed, go the plugins list.

The plugin allows you to switch between the two so you can click one button to go live.</p>\n<h4>Magic Stripe segments</h4>\n<p>The plugin is listening for these events:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li>customer.created,</li>\n<li>customer.updated,</li>\n<li>invoice.paid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stripe docs</a> for more details.</p>\n<h4>Webhook testing</h4>\n<p>Go to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stripe Dashboard</a>. Use the Test mode to test your workflows before you go live. It will allow you to make payments without actually transferring funds.

So you can test what contents this AI model generates even without this plugin. It is as powerful as having a copywriter on your team. It can generate as entertaining emails as you ask it to.</p>\n<h4>Templates</h4>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfhRIlKUiro?si=4EQO6R6LtNSM4b7r\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The AI Plugin works well with Mautic's templates. We recommend you to use the following lighter templates with the AI Plugin to save money on the Open AI's credits. More you can find out <a href=\"https://chimpino.com/themes/\">Themes</a> section.</p>\n<p>Those themes are based on the original Mautic templates but all the demo content was removed so they are way smaller then the stock Mautic templates.</p>\n<h4>Code Mode and MJML</h4>\n<p>Mautic's Code Mode allows you to copy-paste your own template. With AI plugin you can describe how the template should look like and let it generate the template for you.</p>\n<p>The template will be written in <a href=\"https://mjml.io/\">MJML</a> instead of classic HTML so you can be sure that it will be responsive and rendered the same way for every email provider and every inbox.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it will allow you to edit the email in the Email Builder like any other MJML template so you don't have to edit the source code.</p>\n<h4>Translations, A/B tests generated in seconds</h4>\n<p>Once you are happy with your email content, Mautic natively allows you to create A/B tests or translations. Just prompt the plugin to build the same content but in another language. The GPT model can communicate in more than 95 languages. It's like having a translator on your team 24/7.</p>\n<h4>Prompt memory</h4>\n<p>The AI Plugin remembers what prompt and response was used last on each email. The information is stored directly in Mautic's database. So you know how the email came to be even after several years. You can browse the history of the prompts and responses so you can get back to a previous version that you liked better.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js\"></script>\n<stripe-pricing-table pricing-table-id=\"prctbl_1NIdxzDe6Bz3HFJoDWtWURdC\" publishable-key=\"pk_live_51NFhPoDe6Bz3HFJoBZkdv4NpV6hzKqD9rnSHtNOuh65VyduCcPENh2joNvfmV8Mr2AdxdzZZ3ueeAsikeuTwYT9D00OLPZzyaO\"> </stripe-pricing-table></p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<div id=\"instalation\" class=\"container\">\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Once you become our member, you receive an email with a link to download the latest version of the AI bundle.

After that you'll have to pre-pay some credits. $10 should last you months. Depending on usage. Open AI is also <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates\" id=\"links\">constantly lowering the cost</a>. Learn more on their <a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing\" id=\"links\"><strong>pricing page</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>Why did you go with the subscription payment model over one time payment?</h3>\n<p>We are going for a sustainable monetisation model. We want to evolve this plugin and add even more value to our members over time. See the <a href=\"https://chimpino.com/#roadmap\">Roadmap</a> for what we plan. We are sure our members will appreciate that the plugin will get:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li>new features</li>\n<li>bug and security fixes</li>\n<li>updates for new PHP and Mautic versions</li>\n<li>support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The subscription model will allow us to do that. As a software users ourselves we hate it when the maintainer of a software we use stops supporting it. We don't want it to happen to our customers.</p>\n<h3>How long will it take to get my investment back?</h3>\n<p>Consider how much faster it will take you to write engaging emails with AI. Let's say that now it takes you 30 minutes to write a nice email. With AI it may take you 5 minutes to get it done. To convert time to money, let's say that your hourly rate is $50. So you <strong>save $25 per email</strong>. Here is how long it will take to get your investment back per plan:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li>for 1 Mautic instance plan that costs $89 then it will take you 4 emails to get your investment back.</li>\n<li>for 5 Mautic instances plan that costs $140 then it will take you little over 1 email to get your investment back.</li>\n<li>for 500 Mautic instances plan that costs $500 then it will take you way less than 1 email to get your investment back.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What if I don't want to pay for the plugin anymore?</h3>\n<p>Of course you can cancel the subscription any time and get just one year of updates. There will be a link to where you can change subscription plans or cancel it completely any time in the payment confirmation email from Stripe.</p>\n<h3>What if I won't like the plugin?</h3>\n<p>Adding value to our customers is the most important thing that we strive for. This presentation and video should give you good idea of what the plugin does. You can also test the email generation in <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">Chat GPT</a> for free without purchasing this plugin. So you should get a good idea of what the plugin does before you purchase it. We would like to avoid sending money back and forth. In order to make a refund you would have to prove that the plugin is not doing what is advertised here. We can't know that you won't be using the plugin as you would have the source code after the purchase. Please take your time when evaluating this plugin.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"roadmap\" class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"container pt-0\">\n<h2>Roadmap</h2>\n<p>There are many features that will come in the future versions. We'll update the capabilities as Open AI will release more powerful models. The plugin itself will evolve too. Here are some features that we want to use ourselves and we can't wait to hear the ideas our customers will request. We'll keep this list updated.</p>\n<h4>Support for Landing Pages</h4>\n<p>The same way we've implemented the GPT model for emails, we want to do the same for Landing pages.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">Prompt history</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">The plugin can already remember the prompts and responses you are using and it will show you the latest one. But it would be cool if you could see the history of previous prompts you've used on each particular email.</span> - Released in version 0.1.0</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">Prompt library</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">Writing a good prompt is not that simple. We should not start from scratch every time. We plan a prompt library where you could categorize the prompts you are proud of and reuse them as a starting point for new emails or landing pages.</span> - Released in version 0.1.0</p>\n<h4>Email subject generation</h4>\n<p>Once you are done with your content the GPT model could also give you a selection of top 5 subjects that you could choose from.</p>\n<h4>Support for Mautic 5</h4>\n<p>Mautic 5 is close to an alpha version (written on June 15) and we want to prepare a version for the fresh Mautic 5 as well.</p>\n<h4>Speech to text</h4>\n<p>Typing is slow and inconvenient. Why wouldn't we just dictate our prompts instead?</p>\n<h4>Image generation</h4>\n<p>Generating text is a big deal for marketers. But text isn't the only content the AI models can generate these days. One image is worth a 1000 words.</p>\n<h4>Report generation</h4>\n<p>We'd like to explore how well we can use AI to generate reports from a user prompt. It would be exciting to get this working.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n<div id=\"configuration\" class=\"container\">\n<div> </div>\n</div>",
