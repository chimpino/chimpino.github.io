Help your team to automate payment processes and improve your customer experience at the same time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forget about click-through rate or open rate. <strong>Payment rate</strong> is what really matters!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h4>Magic segments</h4>\n<p>Segment filters seem like a good idea at first. But they have serious drawbacks.</p>\n<p>The main is that contacts will get to the segment only after your cron job runs. So every 10 minutes or so. That's way too slow! Your customers expect <strong>faster reactions</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Another is, ask your server admin how much does it cost to rebuild each and every segment every 10 minutes. It's not cheap.</em> ü§´</p>\n<p>The magic is quite simple, really. When you install this plugin, it will create a new segment for each Stripe event. And every time Stripe event happens, it will add the contact to the right segment. Fast, cheap, simple.</p>\n<p>And this simple magic allows you to run <strong>repeatable campaigns</strong>!</p>\n<h4>Segment filters</h4>\n<p>That being said, if you need a segment of all <strong>Stripe customers</strong>, we have you covered. There is a segment filter for that. It will give you all contacts that have a relation to a Stripe Customer.</p>\n<p>Tip: Stripe Customer doesn't have to be only a contact who paid for something. It could be a someone who filled in the checkout form but the payment didn't go through. I see the üí° that came up in your marketer mind. I smell abandoned card scenario in the air! More on that later.</p>\n<h4>Landing page tokens</h4>\n<p>Stripe gives you a short HTML code to embed <strong>pricing tables</strong> or <strong>pay buttons</strong> to Mautic Landing Pages. We've tried that, doesn't work. The editor will strip parts of the HTML. We've got you covered. This plugin comes with special tokens for pricing tables and buttons. Details in the docs.</p>\n<h4>Email tokens</h4>\n<p>Stripe already allows you to add a link to a <strong>subscription management</strong> for your customers. It allows them to insert their email address and cancel or upgrade or downgrade their subscription. It's unique to your Stripe account. So there is no need for a token. It works out of the box.</p>\n<p>What we added a token for is the <strong>invoice link</strong>. Stripe generates an invoice for every payment. The token will find the latest invoice link in the Stripe events and send replace the token with it.</p>\n<p>Wait, wait what about the <strong>digital asset download link</strong>? That's a core Mautic feature, don't worry.</p>\n<p>There is one more thing that we didn't have to implement. The <strong>Stripe payment button works in the email</strong> already. It's just a link. You can send your contact to the payment gate directly from the email content. And track it with Mautic. Sweet!</p>\n<h4>Campaign conditions</h4>\n<p>Right, the <strong>abandoned cart</strong> type of workflow. There is a campaign condition that allows you to decide whether a contact went through one type of event but not another. So if you check if the \"Customer Created\" event exists, wait a day and check if the \"Invoice Paid\" event does not exist, you can send a message (SMS, email) to the contact asking what's wrong.</p>\n<p>Once you have more than 1 product, you may want to create <strong>different workflows for different products</strong>. We have a campaign condition for just that!</p>\n<h4>Security</h4>\n<p>We've got you covered. Stripe sends the events to a public endpoint that the Stripe plugin configures. So some comedian could start sending similar events there. Don't worry, Stripe is signing each event message with secret key. You have to insert the secret key to the plugin configuration in order to be able to accept the messages. The plugin will reject all event messages that are not correctly signed.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js\"></script>\n<stripe-pricing-table pricing-table-id=\"prctbl_1OChTlDe6Bz3HFJoRcBk9foN\" publishable-key=\"pk_live_51NFhPoDe6Bz3HFJoBZkdv4NpV6hzKqD9rnSHtNOuh65VyduCcPENh2joNvfmV8Mr2AdxdzZZ3ueeAsikeuTwYT9D00OLPZzyaO\"> </stripe-pricing-table></p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<div id=\"instalation\" class=\"container\">\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Once you become our member, you receive an email with a link to download the latest version of the Stripe bundle.

You should see the Stripe Plugin within your other plugins. Save your <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys\">test</a> and <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys\">production</a> Secret keys. The plugin allows you to switch between the two so you can click one button to go live.</p>\n<h4>Magic Stripe segments</h4>\n<p>The plugin is listening for these events:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li>customer.created,</li>\n<li>customer.updated,</li>\n<li>customer.subscription.created,</li>\n<li>customer.subscription.updated,</li>\n<li>invoice.paid.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stripe docs</a> for more details.</p>\n<h4>Webhook testing</h4>\n<p>Go to the <a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stripe Dashboard</a>. Use the Test mode to test your workflows before you go live. It will allow you to make payments without actually transferring funds.

With AI plugin you can describe how the template should look like and let it generate the template for you.</p>\n<p>The template will be written in¬†<a href=\"https://mjml.io/\">MJML</a>¬†instead of classic HTML so you can be sure that it will be responsive and rendered the same way for every email provider and every inbox.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it will allow you to edit the email in the Email Builder like any other MJML template so you don't have to edit the source code.</p>\n<h4>Translations, A/B tests generated in seconds</h4>\n<p>Once you are happy with your email content, Mautic natively allows you to create A/B tests or translations. Just prompt the plugin to build the same content but in another language. The GPT model can communicate in more than 95 languages. It's like having a translator on your team 24/7.</p>\n<h4>Prompt memory</h4>\n<p>The AI Plugin remembers what prompt and response was used last on each email. The information is stored directly in Mautic's database. So you know how the email came to be even after several years. You can browse the history of the prompts and responses so you can get back to a previous version that you liked better.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js\"></script>\n<stripe-pricing-table pricing-table-id=\"prctbl_1NIdxzDe6Bz3HFJoDWtWURdC\" publishable-key=\"pk_live_51NFhPoDe6Bz3HFJoBZkdv4NpV6hzKqD9rnSHtNOuh65VyduCcPENh2joNvfmV8Mr2AdxdzZZ3ueeAsikeuTwYT9D00OLPZzyaO\"> </stripe-pricing-table></p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<div id=\"instalation\" class=\"container\">\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Once you become our member, you receive an email with a link to download the latest version of the AI bundle.

After that you'll have to pre-pay some credits. $10 should last you months. Depending on usage. Open AI is also¬†<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates\" id=\"links\">constantly lowering the cost</a>. Learn more on their¬†<a href=\"https://openai.com/pricing\" id=\"links\"><strong>pricing page</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>Why did you go with the subscription payment model over one time payment?</h3>\n<p>We are going for a sustainable monetisation model. We want to evolve this plugin and add even more value to our members over time. See the <a href=\"https://chimpino.com/#roadmap\">Roadmap</a>¬†for what we plan. We are sure our members will appreciate that the plugin will get:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li>new features</li>\n<li>bug and security fixes</li>\n<li>updates for new PHP and Mautic versions</li>\n<li>support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The subscription model will allow us to do that. As a software users ourselves we hate it when the maintainer of a software we use stops supporting it. We don't want it to happen to our customers.</p>\n<h3>How long will it take to get my investment back?</h3>\n<p>Consider how much faster it will take you to write engaging emails with AI. Let's say that now it takes you 30 minutes to write a nice email. With AI it may take you 5 minutes to get it done. To convert time to money, let's say that your hourly rate is $50. So you¬†<strong>save $25 per email</strong>. Here is how long it will take to get your investment back per plan:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li>for 1 Mautic instance plan that costs $89 then it will take you 4 emails to get your investment back.</li>\n<li>for 5 Mautic instances plan that costs $140 then it will take you little over 1 email to get your investment back.</li>\n<li>for 500 Mautic instances plan that costs $500 then it will take you way less than 1 email to get your investment back.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What if I don't want to pay for the plugin anymore?</h3>\n<p>Of course you can cancel the subscription any time and get just one year of updates. There will be a link to where you can change subscription plans or cancel it completely any time in the payment confirmation email from Stripe.</p>\n<h3>What if I won't like the plugin?</h3>\n<p>Adding value to our customers is the most important thing that we strive for. This presentation and video should give you good idea of what the plugin does. You can also test the email generation in¬†<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt\">Chat GPT</a> for free without purchasing this plugin. So you should get a good idea of what the plugin does before you purchase it. We would like to avoid sending money back and forth. In order to make a refund you would have to prove that the plugin is not doing what is advertised here. We can't know that you won't be using the plugin as you would have the source code after the purchase. Please take your time when evaluating this plugin.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section id=\"roadmap\" class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"container pt-0\">\n<h2>Roadmap</h2>\n<p>There are many features that will come in the future versions. We'll update the capabilities as Open AI will release more powerful models. The plugin itself will evolve too. Here are some features that we want to use ourselves and we can't wait to hear the ideas our customers will request. We'll keep this list updated.</p>\n<h4>Support for Landing Pages</h4>\n<p>The same way we've implemented the GPT model for emails, we want to do the same for Landing pages.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">Prompt history</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">The plugin can already remember the prompts and responses you are using and it will show you the latest one. But it would be cool if you could see the history of previous prompts you've used on each particular email.</span> - Released in version 0.1.0</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">Prompt library</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #95a5a6;\">Writing a good prompt is not that simple. We should not start from scratch every time. We plan a prompt library where you could categorize the prompts you are proud of and reuse them as a starting point for new emails or landing pages.</span> - Released in version 0.1.0</p>\n<h4>Email subject generation</h4>\n<p>Once you are done with your content the GPT model could also give you a selection of top 5 subjects that you could choose from.</p>\n<h4>Support for Mautic 5</h4>\n<p>Mautic 5 is close to an alpha version (written on June 15) and we want to prepare a version for the fresh Mautic 5 as well.</p>\n<h4>Speech to text</h4>\n<p>Typing is slow and inconvenient. Why wouldn't we just dictate our prompts instead?</p>\n<h4>Image generation</h4>\n<p>Generating text is a big deal for marketers. But text isn't the only content the AI models can generate these days. One image is worth a 1000 words.</p>\n<h4>Report generation</h4>\n<p>We'd like to explore how well we can use AI to generate reports from a user prompt. It would be exciting to get this working.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n<div id=\"configuration\" class=\"container\">\n<div>¬†</div>\n</div>",
