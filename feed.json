It can generate as entertaining emails as you ask it to.</p>\n<h4>Templates</h4>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UfhRIlKUiro?si=4EQO6R6LtNSM4b7r\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p>The AI Plugin works well with Mautic's templates. We recommend you to use the following lighter templates with the AI Plugin to save money on the Open AI's credits:</p>\n<ul class=\"container\">\n<li><a href=\"https://m.chimpino.com/asset/7:paprika-lightzip\" id=\"links\">Paprika Light</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://m.chimpino.com/asset/6:brienz-lightzip\" id=\"links\">Brienz Light</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those tokens are based on the original Mautic templates but all the demo content was removed so they are way smaller then the stock Mautic templates.</p>\n<h4>Code Mode and MJML</h4>\n<p>Mautic's Code Mode allows you to copy-paste your own template. With AI plugin you can describe how the template should look like and let it generate the template for you.</p>\n<p>The template will be written in <a href=\"https://mjml.io/\">MJML</a> instead of classic HTML so you can be sure that it will be responsive and rendered the same way for every email provider and every inbox.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it will allow you to edit the email in the Email Builder like any other MJML template so you don't have to edit the source code.</p>\n<h4>Translations, A/B tests generated in seconds</h4>\n<p>Once you are happy with your email content, Mautic natively allows you to create A/B tests or translations. Just prompt the plugin to build the same content but in another language. The GPT model can communicate in more than 95 languages. It's like having a translator on your team 24/7.</p>\n<h4>Prompt memory</h4>\n<p>The AI Plugin remembers what prompt and response was used last on each email. The information is stored directly in Mautic's database. So you know how the email came to be even after several years. You can browse the history of the prompts and responses so you can get back to a previous version that you liked better.</p>\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<p>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://js.stripe.com/v3/pricing-table.js\"></script>\n<stripe-pricing-table pricing-table-id=\"prctbl_1NIdxzDe6Bz3HFJoDWtWURdC\" publishable-key=\"pk_live_51NFhPoDe6Bz3HFJoBZkdv4NpV6hzKqD9rnSHtNOuh65VyduCcPENh2joNvfmV8Mr2AdxdzZZ3ueeAsikeuTwYT9D00OLPZzyaO\"> </stripe-pricing-table></p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<div id=\"instalation\" class=\"container\">\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n<p>Once you become our member, you receive an email with a link to download the latest version of the AI bundle.

Here are some features that we want to use ourselves and we can't wait to hear the ideas our customers will request. We'll keep this list updated.</p>\n<h4>Support for Landing Pages</h4>\n<p>The same way we've implemented the GPT model for emails, we want to do the same for Landing pages.</p>\n<h4>Prompt history</h4>\n<p>The plugin can already remember the prompts and responses you are using and it will show you the latest one. But it would be cool if you could see the history of previous prompts you've used on each particular email.</p>\n<h4>Prompt library</h4>\n<p>Writing a good prompt is not that simple. We should not start from scratch every time. We plan a prompt library where you could categorize the prompts you are proud of and reuse them as a starting point for new emails or landing pages.</p>\n<h4>Email subject generation</h4>\n<p>Once you are done with your content the GPT model could also give you a selection of top 5 subjects that you could choose from.</p>\n<h4>Support for Mautic 5</h4>\n<p>Mautic 5 is close to an alpha version (written on June 15) and we want to prepare a version for the fresh Mautic 5 as well.</p>\n<h4>Speech to text</h4>\n<p>Typing is slow and inconvenient. Why wouldn't we just dictate our prompts instead?</p>\n<h4>Image generation</h4>\n<p>Generating text is a big deal for marketers. But text isn't the only content the AI models can generate these days. One image is worth a 1000 words.</p>\n<h4>Report generation</h4>\n<p>We'd like to explore how well we can use AI to generate reports from a user prompt. It would be exciting to get this working.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>\n<div id=\"configuration\" class=\"container\">\n<div> </div>\n</div>",
